# C Language Reference Guide

Welcome to the C Language Reference Guide. This documentation provides a comprehensive reference of standard C programming language features, focusing on portable code generation.

## Purpose

This guide serves as the specification documentation for the c_codegen Rust library, which generates C code. It documents the C language features and semantics that are essential for generating portable, standards-compliant C code.

## Standards Coverage

The documentation covers:
- ANSI C89/ISO C90 standard features as the baseline
- ISO C99 features where widely supported

The focus is on portable features that work across different C compilers and platforms. GNU-specific and other compiler-specific extensions are intentionally excluded to ensure maximum portability of generated code.
