# 4.3 The if Statement

You can use the if statement to conditionally execute part of your program, based on the truth value of a given expression. Here is the general form of an if statement:

if (test)
  then-statement
else
  else-statement

If test evaluates to true, then then-statement is executed and else-statement is not. If test evaluates to false, then else-statement is executed and then-statement is not. The else clause is optional.

Here is an actual example:

if (x == 10)
  puts ("x is 10");

If x == 10 evaluates to true, then the statement puts ("x is 10"); is executed. If x == 10 evaluates to false, then the statement puts ("x is 10"); is not executed.

Here is an example using else:

if (x == 10)
  puts ("x is 10");
else
  puts ("x is not 10");

You can use a series of if statements to test for multiple conditions:

if (x == 1)
  puts ("x is 1");
else if (x == 2)
  puts ("x is 2");
else if (x == 3)
  puts ("x is 3");
else
  puts ("x is something else");

This function calculates and displays the date of Easter for the given year y:

void
easterDate (int y)
{
  int n = 0;
  int g = (y % 19) + 1;
  int c = (y / 100) + 1;
  int x = ((3 * c) / 4) - 12;
  int z = (((8 * c) + 5) / 25) - 5;
  int d = ((5 * y) / 4) - x - 10;
  int e = ((11 * g) + 20 + z - x) % 30;

  if (((e == 25) && (g > 11)) || (e == 24))
    e++;

  n = 44 - e;

  if (n < 21)
    n += 30;

  n = n + 7 - ((d + n) % 7);

  if (n > 31)
    printf ("Easter: %d April %d", n - 31, y);
  else
    printf ("Easter: %d March %d", n, y);
}
