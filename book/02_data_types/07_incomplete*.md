# 2.7 Incomplete Types

You can define structures, unions, and enumerations without listing their members (or values, in the case of enumerations). Doing so results in an incomplete type. You canâ€™t declare variables of incomplete types, but you can work with pointers to those types.

struct point;

At some time later in your program you will want to complete the type. You do this by defining it as you usually would:

struct point
  {
    int x, y;
  };

This technique is commonly used to for linked lists:

struct singly_linked_list
  {
    struct singly_linked_list *next;
    int x;
    /* other members here perhaps */
  };
struct singly_linked_list *list_head;
